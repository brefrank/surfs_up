# Surfs Up

## Overview

This analysis gathering temperature data for the months of June an December was performed to determine if a surf and ice cream shop would be sustainable year round in Oahu.

## Results

Three major observations from the results below are as follows: 
- The spread between quartiles in both June and December data is small, therefore, the mean temperature calculated is reliable. 
- December's minimum temperature is 8 degrees lower than June's. It is possible that a larger percentage of the days in December are a bit chilly and ice cream consumption might slow down between June and December.
- Although there are slightly more data points for June, the maximimum and average temperatures between June and December are very similar. This is good news and should indicate that sales are not likely to plummet.

## Summary

Overall, the results gathered between the two months seem pretty positive. It would, however, be beneficial to gather a bit more data before making a decision. Two suggestions would be to analyze the average length of time that days are warm as well as the percentage of cloudy vs sunny days for each month. Both of these analyses would help gain better insight into business demand.
